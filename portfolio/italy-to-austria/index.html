						A grand 3,178 kilometer adventure from southern Italy to Vienna, Austria, with a detour through the Swiss Alps.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Italy to Austria race route was made for a Terrain Representation challenge as part of the Graphic Design in Cartography course I was taking. It involved planning and digitizing a real-world route, and then combining it with an aesthetically pleasing terrain basemap that fit with the challenge scenario.
					</p>
					<h3>Mock Scenario Challenge</h3>
					<div class="scenario">
						<p>
							You have been hired by Union Cycliste International to prepare a promotional map for the newly created International Championship Tour, a men’s and women’s road cycling competition to be held every four years as the sport’s main showcase. The location of the International Championship Tour will change for each event as a way to promote cycling internationally.
						</p>
						<p>
							You have been hired as both the geographic consultant and the cartographer, and therefore will be both proposing a route for the first event and providing a sample map for displaying the route.
						</p>
					</div>
					<h3>Project Requirements</h3>
					<p class="requirements">
						<ul>
							<li>Map a route with 21 day-long stages, with each stage covering approximately 100 miles</li>
							<li>Segments must start and end at populated places</li>
							<li>Extent and temporal sequence of stage segments must be clearly symbolized or labeled in the map</li>
							<li>A detailed basemap that includes terrain, land cover, and place name labels is required to give fans a sense of the landscape and scenery along the Tour</li>
							<li>No size restrictions, as the map will be folded when printed and a zoomable PDF when posted online</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<h3>Picking a Location</h3>
					<p>
						Since we were given the freedom of picking our own location for the race, I looked for an area that would be somewhat exotic (at least to someone from the US) and also offer a good variation in terrain over the potential course. Additionally, I wanted somewhere near the ocean as well, as a map showing all land wouldn’t be nearly as interesting.
					</p>
					<p>
						I looked to Europe first for an exotic location, and I settled on Italy as meeting my personal requirements. The route length requirements for the project would allow me to route through all of Italy, with space left over for a trip through the Swiss Alps. While it would be rather sadistic in a real-world setting for riders, for an educational experience it offered good terrain variation.
					</p>
					<h3>Mapping the Route</h3>
					<p>
						The next step was planning and digitizing the route. Detailed route analysis is often a very time consuming exercise. In the military, we often work with countries that don’t have the best infrastructure, and data relating to it is incomplete or outdated as well. Additionally, the types of vehicles that will be in a convoy must be taken into consideration, from their size and weight, to their tires or tracks.
					</p>
					<p>
						Fortunately, things were much easier for this exercise! ArcGIS has some rather useful networking tools with the Network Analyst extension, but in this case I went with the My Maps tool that is part of Google. It was a simple matter to plot a route through Google Maps and then save it as a KML file. From there, I imported the new KML file into ArcMap, split it into points and lines, and saved each separately as the route points and stages.

					<h3>Data Collection and Preparation</h3>
					<p>
						Basic terrain representation used detailed and generalized hillshades for shaded relief, combined with land cover symbolizing terrain coverage.
					</p>
					<p>
						For the hillshades, 15” DEMs were downloaded over the area, and were then mosaiced and merged. This new raster dataset was then resampled to match the resolution of the land cover. From there, two hillshades were created: one with a higher z-factor to exaggerate the terrain features, and another, more generalized version with lower z-factors.
					</p>
					<p>
						For the land cover, I started by removing the water features, as they would be better represented using vector in the final product. Oceans and major water bodies were first extracted using a generic world countries polygon, and then the minor lakes and larger rivers were removed by their raster value with the help of the Nibble geoprocessing function. The remaining land cover was symbolized across the following types: sparse and barren; wood areas; grassland and shrubland; cropland and pasture; and urban areas. Finally, each type was then exported separately to make them easier to work with while post-processing in Photoshop and Illustrator.
					</p>
					<h3>Post-Processing</h3>
					<p>
						As this product was raster-heavy, most of the post-processing work was done in Photoshop. The raw DEM was able to be used as a mask for the hillshades, allowing for adjustments to be made without affecting the rest of the map. The layers levels were adjusted, along with the brightness and contrast values, to highlight the terrain features. Soft brushes were used on the hillshade layer masks to make fine adjustments for accenting some of the more interesting features such as the Alps and other mountain ranges.
					</p>
					<p>
						The land cover was exported individually by type, as this is much easier to work with versus a single coverage layer. Colors were already set in ArcMap, so only a few minor adjustments were required in Photoshop. Using Effects, tweaks were made to some of the colors, while patterns were applied to the croplands and wooded areas to add texture and make them more realistic.
					</p>
					<p>
						For the hydrology, vector was used for everything: oceans, inland water bodies, and rivers. Bathymetry was symbolized in ArcMap and dropped into Photoshop with only minor corrections: adjustments to its brightness levels and the addition of a subtle glow along the shoreline to hide the transition from land raster to ocean vector. Rivers were cleaned up in Illustrator and then added to the final product in Photoshop.
					</p>
					<p>
						In addition to the rivers, the majority of the vector post-processing was conducted in Illustrator. The route segments were merged, points and lines cleaned up, and symbolized. Label halos were added and their positions were fine tuned. And finally, labels were added to denote the three main stages of the race.
					</p>
					<p>
						The final step involved taking the vector work done in Illustrator and adding it to Photoshop. Marginalia was added: the title, legend, and scale bar, in addition to transparent highlights to help with visibility.
					</p>
					<h3>Tools and Data</h3>
					<p>
						The route was planned and created using the My Maps tool from Google. Data preparation was done in ArcMap, while post-processing was completed in both Photoshop and Illustrator. The final outputs were generated with Photoshop.
					</p>
					<p>
						The 15” DEMs were downloaded from Viewfind Panoramas, while the land cover was collected from the Global Land Cover Share Database (2013), provided by the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization. The world bathymetry and populated places vector data was provided by Natural Earth.

A mash-up of graphics and bivariate choropleth maps about America's favorite caffeinated beverage. The _America Loves Coffee_ infographic focuses on the top two traditional coffee providers in the United States: Starbucks and Dunkinâ€™ Donuts.

Most of the initial data clean-up and preparation was done in GRASS GIS. The bivariate maps and inset of New York City were created in QGIS. Legends, labels, and general touch-up was done in Illustrator, with the final outputs produced in Photoshop.

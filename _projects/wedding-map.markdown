My wife and I recently got married on Okinawa, Japan. To help our guests get around the island, we printed out cards with the locations of the chapel and hotels, plus a few useful phrases on the back.

The QR code in the corner linked to a website with an interactive version of the map and our engagement photos.

SVG outlines of the world map and Okinawa were produced in QGIS, while Illustrator was used to create the actual card.

*The wedding website is still up, so please note that the QR code has been blurred for privacy.*

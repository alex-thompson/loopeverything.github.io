Turf.js was used to interpolate continuous surfaces for nitrate values and cancer rates in Wisconsin. The end result was a layer showing the standard deviation of the residuals after generating a linear regression model. 

The client application was created with React, with Leaflet powering the map. The backend consisted of a simple API served by Node/Express which pulled from a PostgreSQL/PostGIS database.

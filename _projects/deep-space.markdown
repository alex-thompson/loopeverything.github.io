A Mapbox tileset style inspired by Star Trek.

Water bodies and bathymetry lines were made to look like stars, while bright colors were used for lines, and a generous dose of futuristic fonts were added for labels.

The result is a fun style resembling an interface or screen commonly found in science fiction movies.

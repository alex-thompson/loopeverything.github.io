A Mapbox tileset style inspired by Star Trek.

Water bodies and bathymetry lines were made to look like stars, while bright colors were used for lines, and a generous dose of futuristic fonts was added for labels.

This project made the shortcomings of science fiction screens readily apparent! After all, who wants to work an entire day with a dark, transparent interface that only uses a handful of similar colors? A map is no different, but I have to admit: it looks cool!

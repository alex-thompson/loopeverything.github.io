[//]: A grand 3,178 kilometer adventure from Southern Italy to Vienna, Austria, with a detour through the Swiss Alps.

The hypothetical Italy to Austria race route was made for a Terrain Representation challenge as part of the Graphic Design in Cartography course I was taking.

It involved planning and digitizing a real-world route, and then combining it with an aesthetically pleasing terrain basemap that fit with the challenge scenario.

The majority of the vector post-processing was conducted in Illustrator, while Photoshop was used to clean up the terrain, tweaking colors and adding textures according to the land cover in order to make it look more realistic and appealing.
